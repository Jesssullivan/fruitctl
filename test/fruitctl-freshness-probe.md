# Attended freshness probe

`fruitctl-freshness-probe.py` runs the TIN-5509 attended probe arms against a
real Screen Sharing target. It uses an already built native controller and
never builds anything. It sends only `health` and `screenshot`. It never
clicks, types or presses keys, and the method gate refuses anything else
before it is written.

The controller is launched as the broker launches it (`lib/broker/server.mjs`
`nativeFactory`, `lib/mcp/native.js`):

- `--host`, `--port` and an optional `--username` come from the argv.
- `--rfb-request-mode stream|on-demand`, `--rfb-wire-ledger`, `--no-reconnect`
  and `-v` are added.
- The credential arrives as one length-prefixed frame on descriptor 3.

The target and credential come from the `VNC_HOST`, `VNC_PORT`,
`VNC_USERNAME` and `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variables. With
`--profile NAME`, they come instead from the broker's
`fruitctl.config.v1` profile and its private `credentialFile`. The credential
is never printed, never placed in the argv and never written to a receipt.

| Arm | Mode | Schedule (defaults) | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P0` | `stream` | 10 captures 10 s apart, then 5 captures, each after 120 s idle | every capture completes in under 5 s; the wire ledger and the provenance each show exactly one full request per capture |
| `P1` | `on-demand` | P0, then 2 captures, each after 600 s idle | P0's criteria; plus the connection generation never changes, `health` reports connected after every gap, `request_gate_leaks == 0`, and no incremental request is written |
| `P-ctl` | `--mode` of the passing arm | a baseline, then 5 captures; before each, the operator changes the screen and presses Enter | each capture hash differs from the previous one |
| `P-eq` | `--mode` of the passing arm | 3 captures on a static screen, the first after the settle time; then a new controller connection, captured at once and again after the settle time | the last in-session capture equals the new connection's settled capture (see below) |

Any capture failure is a FAIL with its reason. A typed `stale_screen`
(`-32010`) is recorded as `stale_screen:<data.reason>` with its diagnostics.
Input on the wire ledger is also a FAIL.

## P-eq settle time and ignore band

macOS shows a "Screen Sharing active" indicator in the menu bar. It fades in
about 1 to 2 s after a viewer connects, so a new connection's first frame can
catch it mid-fade. On 2026-10-16 against PZM this made P-eq always disagree:
the only differing pixels were that indicator, at x 1037-1181, y 1-20 in the
1280x720 scaled frame.

- `--eq-settle-seconds` (default 4) is the wait after each connection is ready
  before its compared capture. It applies to the first in-session capture and
  to the new connection's compared capture. The new connection is also
  captured at once, before the wait, and both hashes are recorded. Only the
  settled capture is judged. A settle time below 4 s is non-qualifying.
- `--eq-ignore-rect X,Y,W,H`, in scaled screenshot coordinates, names a band
  to ignore, such as the status menu. Without it, P-eq compares sha256 only.
  With it, two captures whose hashes differ are decoded and compared pixel by
  pixel outside the band. The same rule decides whether the in-session
  captures were static. The band is mapped onto image pixels, rounding
  outward, when the image size differs from the scaled size.

`eqComparison` in the receipt records the reference, immediate and settled
captures, each with `sha256Equal` and, when the hashes differ, `pixels`:
`equal` (outside the band, or everywhere without one), `diffBox` (the
`[x0, y0, x1, y1)` box around every differing pixel, inside the band too)
and `imageSize`. `decidedBy` names the comparison that decided the verdict:
`settled-sha256` or `settled-pixels-outside-ignore-rect`. `staticDecidedBy`
does the same for the static check.

The standard library has no PNG decoder. The runner decodes the controller's
8-bit, non-interlaced RGB and RGBA PNGs itself with `zlib` and `struct`,
supporting filter types 0 to 4, and refuses any other format. Decoding a
1280x720 RGBA frame takes about 3 s. Pixels stay in memory and reach disk
only with `--save-images`.

Gate leaks are taken as the larger of two counts:

- the controller's verbose "Request gate reopened" log lines;
- any `request_gate_leaks` value in `stale_screen` diagnostics.

The daemon flag `--rfb-wire-ledger` writes to stderr. The runner splits the
`[RFB-WIRE]` lines out to `rfb-wire-ledger.s<N>.txt`, one file per connection.
It assigns each line to a capture by its arrival time.

Durations and counts are configurable for development:

- `--gap-seconds`, `--warm-captures`
- `--idle-seconds`, `--idle-captures`
- `--long-idle-seconds`, `--long-idle-captures`
- `--ctl-captures`, `--eq-captures`, `--eq-gap-seconds`, `--eq-settle-seconds`

A schedule shorter than the design is marked `qualifying: false` in the
receipt.

## Output

The receipt is `freshness-probe-receipt.json`, written to a new
`--output-dir` with mode `0600`. It holds:

- the arm and mode, and the daemon sha256 and size;
- the verified build receipt hash and `sourceRevision`;
- for each capture: `t`, `latency_ms`, `sha256`, `ok`, `reason`, the
  `provenance` returned by the controller, the health read before it, and the
  windowed ledger counts;
- for each connection: ledger totals, gate leaks, `vnc_state` changes and
  exit code;
- for P-eq, `eqComparison` with the immediate and settled hashes and
  `decidedBy`;
- the verdict and its reasons.

The ledger and verbose stderr files are kept next to the receipt. Images are
not saved unless `--save-images` is given. The username is redacted from the
recorded argv.

## Running on an operator seat

The runner only observes. It needs:

- Python 3.9 or newer;
- the controller from the pull request's `Core checks` artifact
  `fruitctl-native-rfb-<run>-<attempt>`;
- an established tunnel to the target.

Keep exactly one attended console owner and no other viewer. Hide the
menu-bar clock and stop anything that animates.

```sh
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
RUN=$(gh run list -R xoxd-ai/fruitctl --workflow 'Core checks' --commit "$SHA" \
  --status success --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')
ATTEMPT=$(gh run view "$RUN" -R xoxd-ai/fruitctl --json attempt -q .attempt)
P="$HOME/fruitctl-probe-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
gh run download "$RUN" -R xoxd-ai/fruitctl -n "fruitctl-native-rfb-$RUN-$ATTEMPT" -D "$P/artifact"
N="$P/artifact/fruitctl-native-$RUN-$ATTEMPT"

# Verify the sha256 and size against build-receipt.json before trusting the bytes.
python3 -I test/fruitctl-freshness-probe.py --probe P1 --profile TARGET \
  --daemon "$N/unstripped-unsigned/claude-kvm-daemon" \
  --build-receipt "$N/build-receipt.json" --dry-run

# actions/upload-artifact drops the exec bit; the runner refuses until you restore it.
chmod 0755 "$N/unstripped-unsigned/claude-kvm-daemon"

python3 -I test/fruitctl-freshness-probe.py --probe P0 --profile TARGET \
  --daemon "$N/unstripped-unsigned/claude-kvm-daemon" \
  --build-receipt "$N/build-receipt.json" --output-dir "$P/P0"
```

Run `P1` the same way, with `--output-dir "$P/P1"`. Then run `P-ctl` and
`P-eq` with `--mode stream` if P0 passed, or `--mode on-demand` if only P1
passed. If the target's RFB banner is slow, add `--connect-timeout 30`. If
the menu-bar indicator still differs after the settle time, add
`--eq-ignore-rect 1037,1,145,20` for a 1280x720 scaled frame.

The exit status is 0 for PASS, 1 for FAIL and 2 for a refusal before
connecting. A pass is evidence about one target, one controller build and one
attended window. It does not qualify other hosts or release builds.

`fruitctl-freshness-probe.test.js` covers the dry run, the refusals, the
receipt, the verdict rules, the P-eq settle and ignore band, and the PNG
decoder offline. It uses a fake controller and small generated PNGs, and
contacts no desktop.
